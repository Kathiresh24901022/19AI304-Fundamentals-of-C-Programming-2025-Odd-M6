  Develop a C program using static storage class in function with parameter and without return to display the incremental float values as indicated in the following output.
| Input | Output                                       |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 101.25&nbsp;&nbsp;201.50&nbsp;&nbsp;301.75&nbsp;&nbsp;402.00&nbsp;&nbsp;502.75 |

# Aim:
To develop a C program using the static storage class in a function with a parameter and without a return value to display the required output.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  a. Declare an integer variable `input` to store the user’s number.  
  b. Inside the function `display(int n)`, declare a static float variable `base` and initialize it to 100.25.
### Step 4:
  Read an integer from the user and store it in `input`.
### Step 5:
  Call the function `display(input)` five times.
### Step 6:
  Inside the `display` function, for each call:  
  a. Calculate the sum of `base` and `n`.  
  b. Display the value.  
  c. Increase the value of `base` by 100.25.
### Step 7:
  Repeat Step 6 for all function calls.
### Step 8:
  Stop
# Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

void display(int n)
{
    static float base = 100.25;
    float value = base + n;
    printf("%.2f  ", value);
    base += 100.25;
}

int main()
{
    int input;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &input);

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        display(input);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
# Output:
```
Enter a number: 1
101.25  201.50  301.75  402.00  502.75
```
# Result: 
Thus, the program was implemented and executed successfully, and the required output was obtained.

  Implement a C program to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two integers using function pointers. The user should input two numbers and select the desired operation from a menu.

# Aim:
  To implement a C program that uses function pointers to perform arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) on two integers based on user choice.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  Declare four functions to perform arithmetic operations:  
  - `add(int a, int b)`  
  - `subtract(int a, int b)`  
  - `multiply(int a, int b)`  
  - `divide(int a, int b)`
### Step 4:
  Declare a function pointer `int (*operation)(int, int)` to point to any of the arithmetic functions.
### Step 5:
  Input two integers from the user (`num1` and `num2`).
### Step 6:
  Display a menu for the user to choose an operation:  
  - Add  
  - Subtract  
  - Multiply  
  - Divide
### Step 7:
  Read the user’s choice.
### Step 8:
  Use a switch statement to assign the function pointer `operation` to the appropriate function based on the user’s choice.  
  - **Step 8.1:** If the choice is 4 (divide), check if the second number is zero. If yes, display an error and terminate.  
  - **Step 8.2:** If the choice is invalid, display an error and terminate.
### Step 9:
  Call the function using the function pointer and store the result in a variable `result`.
### Step 10:
  Display the result.
### Step 11:
  Stop
# Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int subtract(int a, int b) { return a - b; }
int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }
int divide(int a, int b) { return b != 0 ? a / b : 0; }

int main()
{
    int a, b, choice;
    int (*operation)(int, int);

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    printf("\nMenu:\n1. Add\n2. Subtract\n3. Multiply\n4. Divide\n");
    printf("Enter your choice: ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);

    switch(choice)
    {
        case 1: operation = add; break;
        case 2: operation = subtract; break;
        case 3: operation = multiply; break;
        case 4: operation = divide; break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid choice");
            return 0;
    }

    printf("Result = %d\n", operation(a, b));

    return 0;
}
```
# Output:
```
Enter two numbers: 10 5
Menu:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter your choice: 3
Result = 50
```
# Result: 
Thus, the program was implemented and executed successfully, and the required output was obtained.

  Develop a C program to store details of n employees (employee number, name, and salary) using structures, and display the employee(s) with the highest salary.

# Aim:
  To develop and implement a C program that uses a structure to store employee details (employee number, name, and salary) and determine the employee(s) with the highest salary.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  Define a structure `employee` with the following members:  
  - `eno` (employee number)  
  - `ename` (employee name)  
  - `salary` (employee salary)
### Step 4:
  Declare an array of structures to store details of multiple employees.
### Step 5:
  Input the number of employees, `n`.
### Step 6:
  For each employee (`i = 0` to `n-1`), do the following:  
  - **Step 6.1:** Input employee number.  
  - **Step 6.2:** Input employee name (allow spaces).  
  - **Step 6.3:** Input employee salary.  
  - **Step 6.4 (Optional):** Print the entered details for verification.
### Step 7:
  Initialize a variable `high` with the salary of the first employee.
### Step 8:
  For each employee (`i = 1` to `n-1`), do the following:  
  - **Step 8.1:** Compare employee salary with `high`.  
  - **Step 8.2:** If the salary is greater than `high`, update `high` with this salary.
### Step 9:
  Print the details of employee(s) whose salary matches `high`:  
  - **Step 9.1:** Loop through all employees.  
  - **Step 9.2:** If employee salary equals `high`, print employee number, name, and salary.
### Step 10:
  Stop
# Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    char name[30];
    int age;
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s;

    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", s.name);

    printf("Enter age: ");
    scanf("%d", &s.age);

    printf("Enter marks: ");
    scanf("%f", &s.marks);

    printf("\nStudent Details:\n");
    printf("Name  : %s\n", s.name);
    printf("Age   : %d\n", s.age);
    printf("Marks : %.2f\n", s.marks);

    return 0;
}

```
# Output:
```
Enter name: Arjun
Enter age: 19
Enter marks: 87.5

Student Details:
Name  : Arjun
Age   : 19
Marks : 87.50
```
# Result:

  Create the C program to calculate the present age of a person by passing structure as a reference.

# Aim:
  To create a C program that uses a structure to store the current date and birth date, and to calculate the person’s present age in years, months, and days by passing the structure as a reference.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  Define a structure named `date` with members to store:  
  - Current date (`c_date`, `c_month`, `c_year`)  
  - Birth date (`b_date`, `b_month`, `b_year`)  
  - Calculated age (`cal_date`, `cal_month`, `cal_year`)
### Step 4:
  Initialize a structure variable with the current date and birth date values.
### Step 5:
  Pass the structure variable to a function `findAge()` by reference.
### Step 6:
  Inside `findAge()`:  
  - a. Declare an integer array `month[]` to store the number of days in each month.  
  - b. If the birth date is greater than the current date:  
     - Add the number of days of the previous month to the current date.  
     - Decrease the current month by 1.  
  - c. If the birth month is greater than the current month:  
     - Decrease the current year by 1.  
     - Add 12 to the current month.  
  - d. Calculate the age in days, months, and years by subtracting the corresponding birth values from the current values.
### Step 7:
  Return the structure pointer containing the calculated age.
### Step 8:
  Display the calculated age (years, months, and days) in the `main` function.
### Step 9:
  Stop

# Output:
```
Integer: 10
Float  : 25.75
